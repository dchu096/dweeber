# About Dweeber

Need different bots for your music, moderation, roles need? Dweeber is combining it into 1.

It was a bot designed privately for MEmu discord server but decided to actually make it public to give it a try.

The main features of this bot:

> Detailed Moderation: We included detailed moderation system for you to bring to your server. Not just a kick and ban like some discord bot but a full warning system

> channel locking, unlock, nuke set slowmode is also enabled to save your time adjusting the channel settings manually.

> Advanced Entertaining: Dweeber are packed with advanced music features including the most basic play, pause, skip command and more advanced volume, dj, foward, backwards and a non laggy music experience into your server for absolute no cost

> Dashboard: Dweeber will be provided with a useable, decent looking dashboard to manage / view your current queue.

Some general commands are included just to make a bit of details easier.
