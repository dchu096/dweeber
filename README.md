# About Dweeber

Need different bots for your music, moderation, and role management needs? Dweeber is combining it into 1.

It was a bot designed privately for the MEmu discord server but we decided to make it public to give it a try.

The main features of this bot:

> Moderation: We have included a list of moderation commands including kick, ban , mute, tempmute to fit your server needs.

> channel locking, unlock, nuke set slowmode is also enabled to save your time adjusting the channel settings manually.

> Music is a must-include feature if you are a music lover. We have included the basic play, pause, resume, stop, np, queue with the more advanced volume command (which is usually a VIP feature on other bots) to your server without any cost. Also included some extra features like some filters for people who want to listen to music with effects!

> Who doesnt like memes? The bot can pull memes from r/memes with memes commands enabled in the bot.

Some general commands are included just to make a bit of details easier.

You can use getid command to get a user's id

serverinfo and userinfo are some basic commands to tell you about yourself and the server
